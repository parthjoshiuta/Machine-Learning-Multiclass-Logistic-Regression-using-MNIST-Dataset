# Machine-Learning-Multiclass-Logistic-Regression-using-MNIST-Dataset

<b>Problem Statement :</b> Implement Multiclass Logistic Regression for MNIST
Handwritten digits dataset<br>
<b>Language Used :</b> Python<br>
<b>External Libraries Used :</b> Numpy, Mxnet<br>
<b>Activation Function :</b> Sigmoid<br>
<b>Objective Function :</b> Cross Entropy<br>
<b>Dataset :</b> MNIST (Imported from Mxnet)<br>

## Instructions to Run :

<p>The program does not require you to do anything. Once the files are extracted,
you will need to import all the external libraries in the interpreter.
Once the libraries are successfully imported, you can directly run the program in
order to see the results.</p>

## Comments :

<p>I was facing some difficulty while importing the data from sklearn. So I have used
Mxnet for importing the data. So you will need to import mxnet while running
the program. While running the program, it will show a depreciation warning
from mxnet but that does not affect the working of the program so you can
ignore that warning.</p>
<p>The program is currently running at a learning rate of 0.01 and due to less
resources in my laptop, I have reduced the number of iterations to 10. I did test it
with more iterations as well, but I found that the performance was almost the
same.</p>
<p>After running the code multiple times, the program has achieved an accuracy of
approximately 87% to 88%.</p>
<p>It is possible to run the code on the configuration you need by just altering the
learning rate and the number of epochs required.</p>
